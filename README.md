## Setup Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server with nodemon.

## Reflection 
This project provided valuable experience in building a dynamic web app using templating with EJS and server-side routing with Express.js. We learned how to work collaboratively using Github and how to structure a modular Node.js application. The contact form, while simple, demonstrated file-based data handling and form submission logic.
